<h2>Hello!</h2>

<p>I am in the Certificate program for Technical Communication in the Dept of Writing. I plan to continue in the MS program for a Scientific Technical Communication (STC) degree.</p>


<h2>Education</h2>

<p> I am combining my background in biochemical and biophysical reasearch of muscle diseases with writing and technical communication (TC) to explore future career options. I am interested in possibly combining the MS in STC with a minor in business. I am enjoying this reinvention of myself.</p>

<h2>Interests</h2>

<p>I love reading science fiction, mystery, and some romance books. I enjoy watching PBS shows and movies, though I prefer science fiction movies.I like gardening, and I plan to create a vegetable garden in my front lawn.
My dog, Oscar, has claimed the back yard! </p>
